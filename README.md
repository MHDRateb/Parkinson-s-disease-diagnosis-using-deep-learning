Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a chronic, degenerative disorder which leads to a range of motor and
cognitive symptoms. PD diagnosis is a challenging task since its symptoms are very similar to
other diseases such as normal ageing and essential tremor. Much research has been applied to
diagnosing this disease. This project aims to automate the PD diagnosis process using deep
learning, Recursive Neural Networks (RNN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), to
differentiate between healthy and PD patients. Besides that, since different datasets may capture
different aspects of this disease, this project aims to explore which PD test is more effective in
the discrimination process by analysing different imaging and movement datasets (notably cube
and spiral pentagon datasets). In addition, this project evaluates which dataset type, imaging or
time series, is more effective in diagnosing PD.
